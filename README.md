# Windows98-screensaver By Hinan
 A Unity project and reimplement the Windows98 screensaver with following points:
 
 1 - pipes gradually fill a limited three-dimensional space without crossing each other.
 
 2 - Each pipe should be given a random new color.
 
 3 - When a pipe reaches a dead end, it should be continued with a new pipe elsewhere. 
 
 4 - The pipes do not have to look exactly like the original and the bends can be greatly simplified. 
 
 For example, all bends could be represented by a sphere, and all straight parts of the pipes by a cube each.
