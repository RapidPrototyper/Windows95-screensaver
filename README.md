# Windows98-screensaver By Hinan
 a Unity project and reimplement the Windows98 screensaver shown in the video down below, where pipes gradually fill a limited three-dimensional space without crossing each other. Please pay attention to the following, among other things: - Each pipe should be given a random new color. - When a pipe reaches a dead end, it should be continued with a new pipe elsewhere. - The pipes do not have to look exactly like the original and the bends can be greatly simplified. For example, all bends could be represented by a sphere and all straight parts of the pipes by a cylinder each.
